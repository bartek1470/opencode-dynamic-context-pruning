Automatically reduces token usage in OpenCode by managing conversation context.

## Installation

This fork targets **OpenCode V1 1.18.29+ and restricted V2 support**. V1 keeps the
existing compression tool and UI. V2 currently provides conservative automatic
pruning, inspection/manual-mode commands and UI-only notifications; **model-driven
compression is unavailable** because a safe blocking authorization path has not
been verified. Live host/terminal compatibility is still unverified.

Read the [behavior and version differences](docs/compatibility.md) before switching
hosts. The compression sections below describe the V1 adapter unless noted.

For V2, add the plugin using the CLI:

```bash
opencode plugin add @tarquinen/opencode-dcp
```

This installs the package and adds it to your global OpenCode config.

For a local development checkout, build first (`npm ci && npm run build`) and
configure an absolute plugin directory in your project:

```jsonc
{
    "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    "plugins": ["/absolute/path/to/opencode-dynamic-context-pruning-fork"],
}
```

V1 uses the singular `plugin` array instead. Use a pinned package release rather
than `latest` when intentionally keeping a legacy installation. Local development
and published-package loading must be tested separately; changes in this fork are
not automatically present in the upstream npm release.

## Project Status

Development on DCP has slowed because most new context-management work has moved to [Sleev](https://sleev.ai) and the `sleev` CLI. Sleev is a local proxy for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode that builds on DCP's core ideas with newer context-management features and will work with any harness/client.

DCP remains available for OpenCode plugin users, but new features are landing in Sleev first. If you are starting fresh, we recommend trying Sleev:

```bash
npm i -g sleev
sleev
```

## How It Works

DCP reduces context size through a compress tool and automatic cleanup. Your session history is never modified — DCP replaces pruned content with placeholders before sending requests to your LLM.

### Compress

Compress is a tool exposed to your model that replaces closed, stale conversation content with high-fidelity technical summaries. You can think of this as a much smarter version of Opencode's compaction process. Instead of triggering statically when your session reaches its maximum context and on the entire coding session, Compress allows the model to pick when to activate based on task completion, and to only compress the specific messages that are no longer needed verbatim.

DCP supports two compression modes:

- `range` mode compresses contiguous spans of conversation into one or more summaries.
- `message` mode (experimental) compresses individual raw messages independently, letting the model manage context much more surgically.

In `range` mode, when a new compression overlaps an earlier one, the earlier summary is nested inside the new one so information is preserved through layers of compression rather than diluted away. In both modes, protected tool outputs (such as subagents and skills) and protected file patterns are kept in compression summaries, ensuring that the most important information is never lost. You can also enable `protectUserMessages` to preserve your messages verbatim during compression, though note that large prompts (e.g. copy-pasting log files in the prompt) will then never be compressed away.

### Deduplication

Identifies repeated tool calls (same tool, same arguments) and keeps only the most recent output. Recalculated when the compress tool runs, so prompt cache is only impacted alongside compression.

### Purge Errors

Prunes inputs from errored tool calls after a configurable number of turns (default: 4). Error messages are preserved; only the potentially large input content is removed. Recalculated on compress tool use.

## Configuration

DCP uses its own config file, searched in order:

V2 retains these configuration layers without creating a default file on startup.
Compression settings/custom prompts remain accepted but inactive on V2;
`autoUpdate` is V1-only, and V2 `chat` notifications use the UI-only fallback.
See [configuration differences](docs/compatibility.md#notification-behavior-and-configuration).

1. Global: `~/.config/opencode/dcp.jsonc` (or `dcp.json`), created automatically on first run
2. Custom config directory: `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/dcp.jsonc` (or `dcp.json`), if `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` is set
3. Project: `.opencode/dcp.jsonc` (or `dcp.json`) in your project's `.opencode` directory

Each level overrides the previous, so project settings take priority over global. Restart OpenCode after making config changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use models with smaller context windows, such as GitHub Copilot models or local models, lower `compress.minContextLimit` and `compress.maxContextLimit` in your configuration to match the available context.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Defaults are applied automatically. Expand this if you want to review or override settings.

### Commands

On OpenCode V1, DCP provides a TUI panel and one prompt-producing slash command:

- `/dcp` — Opens the DCP panel with context, stats, and manual-mode controls.
- `/dcp-compress [focus]` — Asks the model to run one compression pass. Optional focus text directs what content to compress, following the active `compress.mode`.

On OpenCode V2 the adapter is restricted, so:

- `/dcp` (no arguments) opens a status/help alert; `/dcp status|help|context|stats|manual [on|off]` runs inspection without a model call.
- `/dcp-compress`, `compress`, `sweep`, `decompress`, and `recompress` report that the capability is unavailable. They never prompt the model and never change compression state.
- Notifications are UI-only (toast plus the latest status report); nothing is inserted into the conversation.

### Prompt Overrides

DCP exposes six editable prompts:

- `system`
- `compress-range`
- `compress-message`
- `context-limit-nudge`
- `turn-nudge`
- `iteration-nudge`

This feature is disabled by default. Set `experimental.customPrompts` to `true` in your DCP config to activate it. Prompt overrides apply to the V1 adapter; the restricted V2 adapter does not inject compression prompts.

When enabled, managed defaults are written to `~/.config/opencode/dcp-prompts/defaults/` as plain-text prompt files. A single `README.md` in that directory explains each prompt and how to create overrides.

To customize behavior, add a file with the same name under an overrides directory and edit it as plain text.

To reset an override, delete the matching file from your overrides directory.

### Protected Tools

By default, these tools are always protected from pruning:
`task`, `skill`, `todowrite`, `todoread`, `compress`, `batch`, `plan_enter`, `plan_exit`, `write`, `edit`

The `protectedTools` arrays in `commands` and `strategies` add to this default list.

For the `compress` tool, `compress.protectedTools` ensures specific tool outputs are appended to the compressed summary. By default it includes `task`, `skill`, `todowrite`, and `todoread`.

## Impact on Prompt Caching

LLM providers cache prompts based on exact prefix matching. When DCP prunes content, it changes messages, which invalidates cached prefixes from that point forward.

**Trade-off:** You lose some cache reads but gain token savings from reduced context size and fewer hallucinations from stale context. In most cases, especially in long sessions, the savings outweigh the cache miss cost.

> [!NOTE]
> In testing, cache hit rates were approximately 85% with DCP vs 90% without.

**No impact for:**

- **Request-based billing** — Some providers charge per request, not tokens.
- **Uniform token pricing** — Providers like Cerebras that bill cached and uncached tokens at the same rate.
